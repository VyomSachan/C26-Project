# NUTELLA CREPES – READY IN 10 MINUTES

This Nutella Crepes recipe is heaven on a plate: soft crepes filled with warm oozy Nutella topped with crunchy hazelnuts and served with a dollop of pillowed soft whipped double cream.

### *For this recipe you will need:* 

12 shop bought crepes, 600g Nutella, 50g melted butter, 75g chopped hazelnuts, and 100ml of double cream to serve.

## WHAT ARE CREPES MADE OF?

Common ingredients include flour, eggs, milk, butter and salt. They can be made sweet by adding sugar, or savoury by adding buckwheat flour and left unsweetened.

I bought my fresh crepes from Waitrose (found in the fridge section) they contain wheat flour, pasteurised free range egg, milk, sugar, sugar syrup, water, sunflower oil, lemon juice and salt.

## HOW MANY CREPES SHOULD BE SERVED PER PERSON?

As these Nutella Crepes are quite rich I would say 2 each is plenty. If you follow this recipe and make 12 and have any leftovers they will last in the fridge for 2 days and can be reheated in the oven or microwave.

## HOW TO MAKE NUTELLA CREPES
